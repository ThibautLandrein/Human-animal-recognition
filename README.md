# CCTV
Using Tensorflow and OpenCV. The main functionalities are movement detection, classification of the cause of the movement (logically either a human robbing me or a pet walking by) and saving the picture or video.
For this project I created my own dataset of 24 thousands pictures (I do not know how to store such a large dataset online so message me if you want the data) and trained the model on my computer using tensorflow for gpu.
The components are an i5 4600k and a GTX 1070, the training of the model took roughly 20 min
